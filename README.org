This repository contain source for https://zoom-relay.herokuapp.com.
This application will relay your zoom event to the web, it's event listenable via Server Sent Event, not perfect tho, but it works (kind of).

* How to run it?

Just basic git clone will do, but you need some of these thing:
- Zoom's OAuth Client ID
- Zoom's OAuth Client Secret
- Zoom's OAuth Redirect URL

Which will you set via environment variable:

#+begin_src shell
VITE_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=${YOUR_CLIENT_ID}
VITE_APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=${YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}
VITE_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=${YOUR_REDIRECT_URL}
#+end_src

And here's how you get those thing: https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/oauth, read it don't be lazy.

Then you can just simply run:

#+begin_src shell
yarn build
yarn start
#+end_src

Or if you want to start it as development mode, run this:

#+begin_src shell
yarn develop
#+end_src
